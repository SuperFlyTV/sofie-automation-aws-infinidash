# Sofie automation AWS Infinidash
Library to enable the Sofie TV Automation system to have full vertical intergration with the AWS InfiniDash ecosystem. Bridging the gap between InfiniDash orchestration and more tradiditional proven Node.js deployments.

This library is currently experimental. It currently contains (WIP):

* blog about what has been discovered so far
* terminology related to the DashCore
* simple prototype application that has been used to use InfiniDash hypervisor for self-governed Docker clusters
* draft typescript interface

This library is in no way associated with, or endorsed by, AWS nor the InfiniDash trademark.
