# Sofie automation AWS InfiniDash
Library to enable the Sofie TV Automation system to have full vertical integration with the AWS InfiniDash ecosystem. Bridging the gap between InfiniDash orchestration and more traditional proven Node.js deployments.

This library is currently experimental. It currently contains (WIP):

* blog about what has been discovered so far
* terminology related to the DashCore
* simple prototype application that has been used to use InfiniDash hypervisor for self-governed Docker clusters
* draft typescript interface

## Abstract

## Concept: Infinite single sources of truth
In the hunt for the singlest source of truth, do we sacrifice scalability? What is the tradeoff of monotruth if it won't scale to meet real-world demands â€“ and why do we have to choose in the first place?

We believe that the premise needs to be flipped. Instead of focusing on a single point of truth, let's start embracing multiple points of single truths. The difference is subtle but crucial. In a traditional monotruth paradigm you can only scale within the set keeping your state. Enabled by InfiniDash's messaging component and reactiveness, we can now grow flops (aka. "Flop-farming") of truth in a well-stated manner. Plugging into InfiniDash ReactiStash, we can stack these vertically, for theoretically near-limitless growth.
